Hi , I am navin Iam a software engineer and AI engineer , I love to learn about AI and machine learning and currently I'm working as a software engineer in a japanese company 

Previously , I have worked as a data scientist at a bank in Cambodia , which I have the opportunity to explore various tool in AI and Data science

After several years of experience in AI and Data Science, I’ve realized that building a good model is not the ultimate goal of an AI project. Instead, it's crucial to ensure the model can be deployed into production and scaled effectively, which is where MLOps concepts come into play.

Currently, I’m focused on deploying ML models in production and building AI applications using foundation models. I’m also aiming to earn the **GCP Professional Machine Learning Certificate** to deepen my expertise in cloud-based ML solutions and enhance my ability to develop scalable, reliable AI systems.
